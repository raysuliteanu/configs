# configs
misc config files

For some of this config to work or mean anything, packages may need to be
installed. See Brewfile. Some packages may not be installed via brew but
rather apt.

## TODO
Write a script to check and/or install dependencies not installed by brew
(or better not installed by brew) e.g. rustup.
