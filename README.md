# Misc Scripts

## Misc config files

*NOTE*: configuration files have moved to <https://github.com/raysuliteanu/dotfiles>.

## TODO

Write a script to check and/or install dependencies not installed by brew
(or better not installed by brew) e.g. rustup. Or find something that will do
the same thing e.g. would Nix HomeDir do it? Overkill?
